en-train-0,"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the primary physician because of severe ear pain and yellow discharge from her left ear for the past 2 days. It is also mildly pruritic. The pain started during her last day of summer camp, where she spent a lot of time outdoors hiking, horseback riding, and swimming. Her temperature is 37¬∞C (98.6¬∞F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Examination shows tragal tenderness and a red and edematous external auditory canal. The patient's presentation is most likely due to pleomorphic replacement of normal bone. A diagnostic tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead. The patient reports hearing the sound more loudly in the left ear. To complete the workup, the tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process of the left ear. Once she can no longer hear the sound, the tuning fork is placed in front of the auricle, and she reports no longer hearing the sound.
